Landing Page Project (CSS - Flexbox) for The Odin Project

Finished project for TOP! Still need to improve on managing thing's positions. I feel like I cheated a little bit by combining margins and flexbox, when I could have done it with just Flexbox.

Also, controlling thing's widths and heights is difficult! Must learn.
